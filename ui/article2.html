               Cloud computing is a type of Internet-based computing that provides shared computer processing resources and data to computers and other devices on demand. It is a model for enabling ubiquitous, on-demand access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., computer networks, servers, storage, applications and services),[1][2] which can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort. .</p></div>

 <div color="green"> <p>In 2009, the availability of high-capacity networks, low-cost computers and storage devices as well as the widespread adoption of hardware virtualization, service-oriented architecture, and autonomic and utility computing led to a growth in cloud computing.[8][9][10] Companies can scale up as computing needs increase and then scale down again as demands decrease.[11] In 2013, it was reported that cloud computing had become a highly demanded service or utility due to the advantages of high computing power, cheap cost of services, high performance, scalability, accessibility as well as availability. Some cloud vendors are experiencing growth rates of 50% per year,[12] but being still in a stage of infancy, it has pitfalls that need to be addressed to make cloud computing services more reliable and user friendly.[13][14]
